Just walked out of The Accountant 2, and wow, talk about a rollercoaster — not the fun kind, more like one of those rickety coasters that's about to fall apart while you're on it. Ben Affleck's back, Mr. Spreadsheet Avenger, shooting bad guys and calculating invoices at the same time. Multitasking is underrated, guys, but maybe not when lives are at stake?

It’s like, one moment I'm on the edge of my seat, the next I'm thinking about whether I left the oven on at home. The film tries to mash together action and numbers like it's some kind of movie fusion cuisine, but sometimes I felt like they dropped the salt shaker straight into the pot. Too much, right? Yet, somehow, I couldn’t peel my eyes away, like a construction site in my living room.

> My imaginary friend always says, “Always trust an accountant with your life!” So, naturally, I invited him along. He was silent (as always), but I could tell he was judging each gunfight by CPA regulations. Honestly, glad I don't have him managing my taxes.

There was this one scene where I swear the background music was trying to do more acting than some of the cast. Like, take a break, Beethoven's ghost, we get it. I should maybe download the movie later just to see if it makes any more sense when I can pause and Google “Why is math trying to kill me?”

And speaking of pauses, there was a moment I thought the movie froze like a browser with too many tabs open — wayward characters, a plot spreading thinner than cheap margarine, my brain buffering. But then, boom! Surprise plot twist like a jack-in-the-box — or not much of a surprise if you’ve watched any movie ever.

```javascript
function accountantPlot(twists) {
    const outcome = twists.shift() || shoot more villains;
    if (outcome === account balance) console.log(ben affleck shrugs);
}
accountantPlot([unexpected ally, math saves the day]);
```

Overall, I’d probably tell a friend to watch the movie with snacks and low expectations, exactly the way life should be. Was I entertained? Sorta, in the way you can be entertained by your uncle’s terrible jokes — involuntarily. Still, wouldn’t mind giving it another go one night, just with extra popcorn.
